# Custom-Compiler
This repository contains a custom-built compiler developed to parse, analyze, and translate a specific programming language or domain-specific language (DSL). The project demonstrates core principles of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## âœ¨ Features

- Custom grammar definition
- Lexer and parser implementation
- Semantic error checking
- Code generation or interpretation
- Extensible design for new syntax rules

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python (or specify language if different)
- PLY / ANTLR / Lex-Yacc (if applicable)
- Regex-based tokenization
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-compiler.git
   cd custom-compiler
